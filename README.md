WordTime2 - a customized version of the Pebble
   Textwatch for my wife

[ SDK 2.0 compatible version ]

NOTE: to allow full use of the buttons, WordTime
   loads in as an app (at the same menu level as
   "Settings" on the Pebble), not as a watchface
   . . . it just displays a watchface

Features (v 2.2):
- this app/watchface is based upon the original
  Pebble TextWatch, but modified to meet some
  new requirements as requested by my wife (fix
  minor logic errors & remove all animations)
  for the new Pebble that I gave her for her
  birthday !!
- credit & thanks to sethadam1 for posting his
  source on github (which is what I started
  with for this project)
- credit & thanks to sethadam1 also for the 
  idea of a "debug mode", which I further
  extended by providing a means to selectively
  enable/disable it on-the-fly for demo and/or
  testing purposes

Operating instructions:
- to enter "debug mode", long-press the "select"
  (middle) button (hour is capitalized)
- with "debug mode" on, press the "up" & "down"
  buttons to advance or retard the time by one
  minute
- with "debug mode" on, press & hold the "up" &
  "down" buttons to advance or retard the time
  by one minute repeatedly
- to exit "debug mode", long-press the "select"
  (middle) button (hour is all lowercase)
